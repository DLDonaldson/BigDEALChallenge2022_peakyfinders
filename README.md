# BigDEALChallenge2022_peakyfinders
This code in its present form is shared to enable the reproduction of the approach used by our team the 'peaky-finders' in the [BigDEAL Challenge 2022](http://blog.drhongtao.com/2022/12/bigdeal-challenge-2022-final-leaderboard.html). We hope that the competition data will be made publicly available at a later date to enable further reproducibility. Our approach has been submitted to the IET Smart Grid journal.
